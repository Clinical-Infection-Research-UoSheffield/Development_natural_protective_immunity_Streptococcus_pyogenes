# Early Life Serological Profiles and the Development of Natural Protective Humoral Immunity to *Streptococcus pyogenes* in a High Burden Setting 

Code to reproduce analyses from the SpyCATS longitudinal study of immunity to *Streptococcus pyogenes* in The Gambia.

---

## **Description**

This repository contains the code to reproduce analyses from the manuscript entitled:  
**"Early life serological profiles and the development of natural protective humoral immunity to *Streptococcus pyogenes* in a high burden setting."**

1. **Data Anonymization:**  
    Data including antibody measurements, clinical events, and demographics have been anonymized to protect participant confidentiality.

2. **Analytical Methods:**  
    Analyses include mixed-effects logistic regression to model event probabilities and piecewise regression. Cox proportional hazards models are used to estimate risk across different outcomes, with results formatted into comprehensive tables and plots.

---

## **Data Anonymisation**

- IDs are anonymized by mapping them to randomly generated codes.
- All dates are uniformly offset by a constant to preserve time intervals while concealing actual dates.
- Exact ages are replaced with pseudo-ages randomly generated within defined age groups.

Upon publication, data to reproduce analyses will be made publicly available, hosted on Zenodo at **<insert DOI url>**.
